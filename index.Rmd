Look at the data to see what we need to keep and data types
Starting with Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) data clean up
```{r}
# we see that one of the column name got split into 2: "deaths.1" and "x000.live.births"
# and so the last few columns are offset
str(dirtyIMR) 
```

```{r}
#grab only the columns we want to keep from the IMR data
library(dplyr) # bring in the library

# take the 3 columns we want to keep and change the title to match what we want
cleanIMR <- dirtyIMR %>% select(countryname = slug, 
                                deaths.1000.live.births = deaths.1, 
                                region = ranking) 

str(cleanIMR) # checking the data types of the columns
```

Now working with the Life Expectancy at Birth (LEAB) data
```{r}
str(dirtyLEAB)# the variable here is called "years" and its a num
```
```{r}
# take the 3 columns we want to keep and change the title to match what we want
cleanLEAB <- dirtyLEAB %>% select(countryname = slug, 
                                  years = years, 
                                  region = region) 
str(cleanLEAB) # checking the data types of the columns
```


Now working with the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) data
```{r}
str(dirtyMMR) # the variable here is called "deaths.100" and its an int
# we see that the data column also got split into 2

```

```{r}
# take the 3 columns we want to keep and change the title to match what we want
cleanMMR <- dirtyMMR %>% select(countryname = slug, 
                                  deaths.100000.live.births = deaths.100, 
                                  region = ranking) 
str(cleanMMR) # checking the data types of the columns
```
